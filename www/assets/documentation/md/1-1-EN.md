Welcome to this Atoms tutorial. With these ones easy courses we are going to learn to design a different mobile screen prototype.

<br>

We will learn to add, modify and delete elements from a single file type, the **YAML** file.

<br>
To start with a new project, the easiest way is get the files and directory structure from Atoms [IDE](http://atoms.tapquo.com/session). In addition, the IDE generate all necesary that we need to start the application in our navigator.

<br>
*Files and directory structure:*
```
.

├── bower.json
├── gulpfile.js
├── node_modules
├── package.json

About this tutorial
===================

<br>

As you can see, each chapter of this tutorial is displayed in three columns: first one is for description of prototype that we are going to design; the second column shows the **YAML** code that generates the elements; and the last one is to show the result of prototype.
<br>

You can touch and edit **YAML** column and see in real time the result of your modifications. Try for example to changing the color of button. Add to style the word `theme`:

<br>

```yaml
  - Atom.Button:
      style: fluid big theme
      text: accept
      icon: user
```

In this example we are going to see the **Organism.Footer** properties.

<br>
A *footer* only can be insert in an **Organism.Article**, **Organism.Aside** or in an **Organism.Dialog**.

<br>
In turn, in a *footer* only can be insert an **Atom.Progress**, **Molecule.Div** or a **Molecule.Navigation**.

<br>
For insert a *footer*, we have to declare it in the yaml with an array where we declare its children:

```
- Organism.Footer:
   children: []

```
<br>
In this example we insert a *Molecule.Navigation* that it has three *Atom.Button* child.

<br>
```
children:
  - Molecule.Navigation:
    children:
      - Atom.Button:
          icon: add-user
          path: main/add
          events:
            - touch
      - Atom.Button:
          icon: like2
          count: "14"
          path: main/like
          events:
            - touch
      - Atom.Button:
          icon: refresh
          events:
            - touch
```

<br>
As can be seen, both the first and second button has been added **path** attribute whose function is show indicated section.

<br>
For example, in the first case, we have an attribute path with *main/add* value. This means that show the **Organims.Section** with *add* ID which is in **Organism.Article** with *main* ID.

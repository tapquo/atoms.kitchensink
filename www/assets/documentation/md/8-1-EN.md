In this example we going to see two more *extensions*. One is the **Atom.Gmap** and the other is the **Molecule.Calendar**.

<br>
Work with *Atom.Gmap* is very easy because **Atoms** provide us some events that facilitates the work, for example the event **onGMapQuery**.
<br>

This event receives an address in any format (either full address, only locality, only country...) and it returns all posibility of coincidences with this address in a near radius.

<br>
Also has the event **marker** that send it *latitude* and *longitude* it puts a pushpin in the address.

<br>
<br>
On the other hand, use the **Molecule.Calendar** is very easy too. We have the event **onCalendarSelect** that works whenever user select a concrete day in the calendar. This calendar also has **current** attribute (calendar.current). This shows the current selected day.
<br>

When creates the molecule we can put if we want to leave disabled the days before the actual day. Simply put the attribute **disable_previous_days** with **true** value and no longer could select days before today.
